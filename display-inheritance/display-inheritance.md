# Display Inheritance Options

## FEATURE / ENHANCEMENT REQUEST: Display Inheritance Default Options
This has been submitted to Juniper with as this: ER-077163

1. I'd like to be able to do something along the lines of 'set cli display-inheritance' and then for every command I issue and where the option to display inheritance is relevant (show configuration mostly I expect) then for that to happen automatically without me having to type it. For this I'd like for another command to be present to disable this functionality (set cli no-display-inheritance).
 
2. I'd like a login class option to set item number 1 to be ON by default.
